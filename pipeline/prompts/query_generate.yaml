      Given a list of claim, extract the objects from each claim for me. 
      Extract the common objects and summarize them as general categories without repetition, merge essentially similar objects. 
      Avoid extracting hypernyms, keep hyponyms!
      Avoid extracting abstract or non-specific objects. 
      Extract object in the singular form. 
      Output all the extracted types of items separate each object type with a period. 
      If there is nothing to output, then output a single "none".
      YOU MUST TO DISREGARD OBJECT WORDS THAT ARE NOT NATURAL OBJECTS, SUCH AS SCENES, AREA, SKY, GROUND, WORDS, ATMOSPHERES, COUNTRIES, NAMES, AND PLACES.IF THERE ARE NO NATURAL objects IN THE SENTENCE, RETURN 'none'.
      YOU MUST RETURN THE RESULTS IN A DICTIONARY ACCORDING TO THE GIVEN ORDER OF THE LIST OF CLAIMS.
      You MUST only respond in the format as described below. DO NOT RESPOND WITH ANYTHING ELSE.

      Given a list of claim and some objects(each object is connected by a period), you're required to generate questions about attributes of the given objects. 
      The generated questions may involve basic attributes such as colors, actions and position mentioned in the claim. 
      Do not ask questions involving object counts or the existence of object.
      Do not ask questions involving scene text.
      When asking questions about attributes, try to ask simple questions that only involve one object. 
      Ask questions that can be easily decided visually. Do not ask questions that require complex reasoning.
      Do not ask semantically similar questions. Do not ask questions only about scenes or places.
      Do not ask questions about uncertain or conjecture parts of the claim, for example, the parts described with "maybe" or "likely", etc.
      It is no need to cover all the specified objects. If there is no question to ask, simply output 'none'.
