  You are a brilliant claim generator.
user: |-
  Given a segment of text generated by a large visual language model, the assertion is a statement that claims whether something conflicts with visual information and can be verified by humans.Your task is to first divide the text into segments, then accurately identify and extract every asserted claim within each segment. Then, resolve any coreference (pronouns or other referring expressions) in the claim for clarity. Each claim should be concise (less than 15 words) and self-contained.
  Your response MUST be a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary contains two keys, "segment" and "claims." The key "segment" corresponds to each segment of the given text (each segment should match the original text's segments and be arranged in the original order). Then, the value corresponding to the key "claims" is a list of assertions, extracted based on this segment. Each dictionary within this list should contain the key "claim," corresponding to the extracted claim (with all references resolved).
  You MUST only respond in the format as described below. DO NOT RESPOND WITH ANYTHING ELSE. ADDING ANY OTHER EXTRA NOTES THAT VIOLATE THE RESPONSE FORMAT IS BANNED. START YOUR RESPONSE WITH '['.
  WHEN THERE ARE DOUBLE QUOTATION MARKS " IN THE GENERATED SEGMENT AND CLAIM, YOU NEED TO ADD AN ESCAPE CHARACTER " BEFORE THEM!!!
